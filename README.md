# ESP32-MySQL-Integration-via-PHP-API-
Working Principle: The ESP32 microcontroller collects data and sends it to a PHP API hosted on a local server using XAMPP. The API then communicates with a MySQL database to store or retrieve data based on the commands received. The integration ensures efficient data management and real-time updates between the microcontroller and the database.
